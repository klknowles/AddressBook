For this project, I used the xampp web server. The application is written in PHP, HTML, CSS, and Javascript for front end along with PHP for backend and server side tasks. When you access the application it automatically lists all of the contacts in an easily readable format and gives you the option to add a contact, delete a contact, search for a specific contact, and sort the contact list in alphabetical order. To add a contact you press the "add contact" button, enter the contact's information and press submit. To search for a contact, you press the "Search Contacts" button, enter the contact's name, and press submit. To delete a contact, you press the "Delete Contact" button, enter the contact information, and press submit. To sort the contact list alphabetically, you press the "Sort Contacts" button and prss submit. The app is functional fully, for all of the requirements.
